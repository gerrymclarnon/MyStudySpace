# MyStudySpace

An open access computer finder web app. Using a computer lab feed and Google Map APIs the app enables students and staff to view nearby computer locations 
and the availability of open access computers at those locations. Using a map and a list view of the locations the user can choose to interact with the map or list. 
The locations on the map and list are kept in sync and display the number of available computers at the location and the distance from the user's location.

Detailed information for a location is available including rooms, directions and duration of travel to the location (based on the user's current location). 
The user can filter on campus areas and set their preferred method of travel and imperial or metric units of measure. 

The app has been built with Ionic2 (Angular2 & TypeScript) to give an app like user experience. It also makes for an easy method of creating a native app version in the future.
